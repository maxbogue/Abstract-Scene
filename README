An awesome 3D scene for CG1.  Developed and built on Mac OS X, but the
makefile supports the following:

    Solaris Build:
      - make
      - make all
      - make tessellation
    OS X Build:
      - make mac
    Cleanup:
      - make clean
      - make realclean

I hope you enjoy!  No teapots, I promise.  I hope the movement is correct;
it would have been interesting to support moving in the camera direction,
but the project description didn't really seem to support that so I took
forward to mean the positive x-axis...
